## Description

8 Puzzle Solver is a full-stack website that provides an interactive platform to solve the classic 8 puzzle game using various search algorithms. The project utilizes Flask for the backend API and ReactJS for the frontend.

The 8 puzzle game involves a 3x3 board with numbered tiles from 1 to 8 and an empty space. The objective is to arrange the tiles in ascending order by sliding them into the empty space using the minimum number of moves.

<!-- If there are specific backend and frontend installation steps, mention them here -->

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed by following the [installation](#installation) steps.
2. Start the backend server: `python app.py`
3. Start the frontend development server: `npm start`
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the website.
5. Randomize the board by clicking the "Randomize Board" button.
6. Choose a search algorithm from the available options (A*, Uniform Cost Search, Greedy Search, BFS, DFS).
7. Select a distance function (Euclidean or Manhattan).
8. Click the "Solve" button to see the algorithm in action.
9. The solved board and the cost of solving it will be displayed.
